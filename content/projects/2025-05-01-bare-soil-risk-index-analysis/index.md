## The Challenge

Anglian Water needed to predict pollutant mobilisation risk for surface water management. Traditional monitoring methods were reactive and couldn't provide early warnings of potential water quality deterioration. The challenge was to develop a proactive system that could identify risk areas before water quality issues occurred.

## The Solution

Developed a comprehensive risk assessment system using satellite imagery and environmental data:

**Data Collection & Processing:**
- Utilized Sentinel-2 satellite imagery via Google Earth Engine
- Integrated rainfall data and water quality measurements
- Performed geospatial analysis to identify bare soil exposure patterns

**Model Development:**
- Built a risk-based matrix model using BSRI trends as an early-warning indicator
- Performed environmental risk analysis to quantify BSRI hotspots
- Evaluated relationships between land exposure, rainfall patterns, and water quality indicators

**Validation & Deployment:**
- Evaluated model performance using ROC AUC and statistical diagnostics
- Achieved reliable early-warning signal capability for water quality deterioration
- Built interactive dashboards using Looker Studio for non-technical stakeholders

## Results & Impact

- Successfully quantified BSRI hotspots across the service area
- Developed reliable early-warning system for water quality deterioration
- Created actionable dashboards for environmental impact communication
- Validated model performance using ROC AUC and statistical diagnostics
- Enabled proactive surface water management decisions
