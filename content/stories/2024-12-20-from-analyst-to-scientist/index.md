# From Data Analyst to Data Scientist: My Journey

Two years at Bank Jago as a Data Analyst taught me invaluable lessons about working with data at scale. Now, pursuing my MSc at Imperial College London, I'm reflecting on this transition and what it takes to move from analytics to data science.

## The Analytics Foundation

### What I Learned at Bank Jago

Working with **10 million users** taught me:

**1. Scale Matters**

Building pipelines for millions of users is different from small datasets:
- SQL optimization becomes critical
- BigQuery and cloud platforms are essential
- Data quality issues multiply at scale

**2. Business Impact Over Technical Perfection**

The best model is useless if stakeholders don't understand it:
- Clear visualizations trump complex algorithms
- Dashboards need to answer business questions
- Communication is as important as coding

**3. Production is Different from Notebooks**

Moving from Jupyter to production systems requires:
- Automated pipelines (we used Airflow)
- Error handling and monitoring
- Version control and documentation

## The Transition to Data Science

### Why I Pursued an MSc

After two years in industry, I wanted to deepen my technical skills:
- **Machine Learning**: Beyond basic models
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks and transformers
- **Environmental Applications**: Combining my engineering background with data science

### Key Differences

**Data Analyst**:
- Focus: Descriptive and diagnostic analytics
- Tools: SQL, BI tools, Python for analysis
- Output: Dashboards, reports, insights

**Data Scientist**:
- Focus: Predictive and prescriptive analytics
- Tools: ML frameworks, statistical modeling
- Output: Models, predictions, recommendations

## Bridging the Gap

### Skills That Transfer

1. **SQL Mastery**: Still essential for data science
2. **Data Cleaning**: 80% of the work in both roles
3. **Stakeholder Communication**: Critical for impact
4. **Business Acumen**: Understanding the "why"

### New Skills to Develop

1. **Statistics**: Deeper understanding of probability and inference
2. **Machine Learning**: Algorithms, validation, deployment
3. **Programming**: More advanced Python, software engineering practices
4. **Math**: Linear algebra, calculus for deep learning

## Practical Advice

### For Analysts Wanting to Transition

**1. Start with Projects**

Don't wait for permission:
- Build ML models on your current data
- Propose predictive analytics projects
- Share results with your team

**2. Learn Systematically**

Follow a structured path:
- Online courses (Coursera, fast.ai)
- Books (Hands-On ML, Deep Learning)
- Practice on Kaggle

**3. Leverage Your Strengths**

Your analytics background is valuable:
- You understand data pipelines
- You know how to communicate insights
- You have business context

## Conclusion

The transition from analyst to scientist isn't about abandoning your analytics skills—it's about building on them. The best data scientists I know have strong analytics foundations.

Whether you're an analyst looking to transition or a scientist wanting industry impact, remember:
- **Technical skills** get you in the door
- **Business understanding** keeps you relevant
- **Communication** creates impact

The journey continues, and I'm excited to see where it leads!
